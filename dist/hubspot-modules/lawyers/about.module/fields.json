After almost 20 years of successful practice, Mr. D’Amore wanted to create a personal injury law firm that focused on the real-life needs of people who had been catastrophically injured by the negligence of others.</p>\n<p>Over the course of his career, Paul learned that these types of cases require a deep understanding of the clients themselves, and the \u0003global impact the injury has had on their bodies, their lives, and their families. Employing this philosophy requires each personal injury lawyer at our firm to fully commit to the client, and place everything else second.</p>\n<p>Our attorneys work on your behalf to get you the compensation \u0003that you deserve. We believe that negligence needs to be met fairly. You deserve to worry less about how to get the help you need and focus more on healing and moving forward. We’ll work around the clock to assure that you are fully and fairly compensated for the \u0003injuries and damages you and your family have suffered.</p>\n<p>Getting justice for you and your family is all that matters to us. If you or a loved one has been seriously injured because of someone else’s mistake, contact us.</p>"
