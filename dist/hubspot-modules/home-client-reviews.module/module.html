            "Working with Paul D’Amore has been a wonderful experience. He has been professional, compassionate and
            dedicated to my
            daughter’s case every step of the way. It has truly been a pleasure and a privilege working with Mr.
            D’Amore.
            I would
            definitely recommend him to anyone."
